<div class="clearfix">
  <img cCol md="6" class="float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" src="assets/img/angular.jpg" alt="CoreUI for Angular" />

  <p>
    Notice the use of <code>cCol md="6"</code> directive. We're using it here to show the use of the
    clearfix class. We're adding quite a few meaningless phrases here to
    demonstrate how the columns interact here with the floated image.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now
    imagine how this would look with some actual content in here, rather than
    just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually conveys
    no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not really
    be read.
  </p>

  <p>
    And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text,
    hoping for some more insights, or some hidden easter egg of content. A joke,
    perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.
