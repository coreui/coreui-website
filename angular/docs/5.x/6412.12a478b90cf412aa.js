We most commonly use `min-width` in our media queries.\n\n- **Mobile first, responsive design is the goal.** CoreUI CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.\n\n## Available breakpoints\n\nCoreUI for Angular includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as _grid tiers_, for building responsively.

Breakpoints are also representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions\u2014they don't specifically target every use case or device. Instead, the ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.\n\nThese breakpoints are customizable via Sass\u2014you'll find them in a Sass map in our `_variables.scss` stylesheet.\n\n```scss\n$grid-breakpoints: (\n  xs: 0,\n  sm: 576px,\n  md: 768px,\n  lg: 992px,\n  xl: 1200px,\n  xxl: 1400px\n);\n```\n\nFor more information and examples on how to modify our Sass maps and variables, please refer to [the Sass section of the Grid documentation](https://coreui.io/docs/layout/grid#sass).\n\n## Media queries\n\nSince CoreUI for Angular is developed to be mobile first, we use a handful of [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to create sensible breakpoints for our layouts and interfaces. These breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport changes.\n\n### Min-width\n\nCoreUI for Angular primarily uses the following media query ranges\u2014or breakpoints\u2014in our source Sass files for our layout, grid system, and components.\n\n```scss\n// Source mixins\n\n// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it's effectively `@media (min-width: 0) { ... }`\n@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(md) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(lg) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(xl) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(xxl) { ... }\n\n// Usage\n\n// Example: Hide starting at `min-width: 0`, and then show at the `sm` breakpoint\n.custom-class {\n  display: none;\n}\n@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {\n  .custom-class {\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese Sass mixins translate in our compiled CSS using the values declared in our Sass variables. For example:\n\n```scss\n// X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)\n// No media query for `xs` since this is the default in CoreUI\n\n// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)\n@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }\n\n// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)\n@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }\n\n// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)\n@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }\n\n// X-Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)\n@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }\n\n// XX-Large devices (larger desktops, 1400px and up)\n@media (min-width: 1400px) { ... }\n```\n\n### Max-width\n\nWe occasionally use media queries that go in the other direction (the given screen size *or smaller*):\n\n```scss\n// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it's effectively `@media (max-width: 0) { ... }`\n@include media-breakpoint-down(sm) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-down(md) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-down(lg) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-down(xl) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-down(xxl) { ... }\n\n// Example: Style from medium breakpoint and down\n@include media-breakpoint-down(md) {\n.custom-class {\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese mixins take those declared breakpoints, subtract `.02px` from them, and use them as our `max-width` values. For example:\n\n```scss\n// X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)\n@media (max-width: 575.98px) { ... }\n\n// Small devices (landscape phones, less than 768px)\n@media (max-width: 767.98px) { ... }\n\n// Medium devices (tablets, less than 992px)\n@media (max-width: 991.98px) { ... }\n\n// Large devices (desktops, less than 1200px)\n@media (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }\n\n// X-Large devices (large desktops, less than 1400px)\n@media (max-width: 1399.98px) { ... }\n\n// XX-Large devices (larger desktops)\n// No media query since the xxl breakpoint has no upper bound on its width\n```\n\n"),e.eAF(),e.C$Y(),e.I0R(68,"div",4)(69,"strong"),e.OEk(70,"Why subtract .02px?"),e.C$Y(),e.OEk(71," Browsers don\u2019t currently support "),e.I0R(72,"a",5),e.OEk(73,"range context queries"),e.C$Y(),e.OEk(74,", so we work around the limitations of "),e.I0R(75,"a",6)(76,"code"),e.OEk(77,"min-"),e.C$Y(),e.OEk(78," and "),e.I0R(79,"code"),e.OEk(80,"max-"),e.C$Y(),e.OEk(81," prefixes"),e.C$Y(),e.OEk(82," and viewports with fractional widths (which can occur under certain conditions on high-dpi devices, for instance) by using values with higher precision.\n"),e.C$Y(),e.I0R(83,"markdown"),e.EdD(),e.OEk(84,"\n### Single breakpoint\n\nThere are also media queries and mixins for targeting a single segment of screen sizes using the minimum and maximum breakpoint widths.\n\n```scss\n@include media-breakpoint-only(xs) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(sm) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(lg) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(xl) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(xxl) { ... }\n```\n\nFor example the `@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }` will result in :\n\n```scss\n@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991.98px) { ... }\n```\n\n### Between breakpoints\n\nSimilarly, media queries may span multiple breakpoint widths:\n\n```scss\n@include media-breakpoint-between(md, xl) { ... }\n```\n\nWhich results in:\n\n```scss\n// Example\n// Apply styles starting from medium devices and up to extra large devices\n@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }\n```\n"),e.eAF(),e.C$Y()),2&a&&(e.yG2(),e.cNF(m.title),e.yG2(2),e.cNF(m.description))},dependencies:[d._,i.Af],styles:["[_nghost-%COMP%]{display:block}"],changeDetection:0})}return n})()}}]);
