We most commonly use `min-width` in our media queries.\n\n- **Mobile first, responsive design is the goal.** CoreUI's CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.\n\n## Available breakpoints\n\nCoreUI for Angular includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as _grid tiers_, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if you're using our source Sass files.\n"),e.fQ9(),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(7,"table",2)(8,"thead")(9,"tr")(10,"th"),e._uU(11,"Breakpoint"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(12,"th"),e._uU(13,"Class infix"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(14,"th"),e._uU(15,"Dimensions"),e.qZA()()(),e.TgZ(16,"tbody")(17,"tr")(18,"td"),e._uU(19,"X-Small"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(20,"td")(21,"em"),e._uU(22,"None"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(23,"td"),e._uU(24,"<576px"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(25,"tr")(26,"td"),e._uU(27,"Small"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(28,"td")(29,"code"),e._uU(30,"sm"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(31,"td"),e._uU(32,"\u2265576px"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(33,"tr")(34,"td"),e._uU(35,"Medium"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(36,"td")(37,"code"),e._uU(38,"md"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(39,"td"),e._uU(40,"\u2265768px"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(41,"tr")(42,"td"),e._uU(43,"Large"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(44,"td")(45,"code"),e._uU(46,"lg"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(47,"td"),e._uU(48,"\u2265992px"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(49,"tr")(50,"td"),e._uU(51,"Extra large"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(52,"td")(53,"code"),e._uU(54,"xl"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(55,"td"),e._uU(56,"\u22651200px"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(57,"tr")(58,"td"),e._uU(59,"Extra extra large"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(60,"td")(61,"code"),e._uU(62,"xxl"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(63,"td"),e._uU(64,"\u22651400px"),e.qZA()()()(),e.TgZ(65,"markdown"),e.IAx(),e._uU(66,"\nEach breakpoint was chosen to comfortably hold containers whose widths are multiples of 12. Breakpoints are also representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions\u2014they don't specifically target every use case or device. Instead, the ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.\n\nThese breakpoints are customizable via Sass\u2014you'll find them in a Sass map in our `_variables.scss` stylesheet.\n\n```scss\n$grid-breakpoints: (\n  xs: 0,\n  sm: 576px,\n  md: 768px,\n  lg: 992px,\n  xl: 1200px,\n  xxl: 1400px\n);\n```\n\nFor more information and examples on how to modify our Sass maps and variables, please refer to [the Sass section of the Grid documentation](https://coreui.io/docs/layout/grid#sass).\n\n## Media queries\n\nSince CoreUI for Angular is developed to be mobile first, we use a handful of [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to create sensible breakpoints for our layouts and interfaces. These breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport changes.\n\n### Min-width\n\nCoreUI for Angular primarily uses the following media query ranges\u2014or breakpoints\u2014in our source Sass files for our layout, grid system, and components.\n\n```scss\n// Source mixins\n\n// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it's effectively `@media (min-width: 0) { ... }`\n@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(md) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(lg) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(xl) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(xxl) { ... }\n\n// Usage\n\n// Example: Hide starting at `min-width: 0`, and then show at the `sm` breakpoint\n.custom-class {\n  display: none;\n}\n@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {\n  .custom-class {\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese Sass mixins translate in our compiled CSS using the values declared in our Sass variables. For example:\n\n```scss\n// X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)\n// No media query for `xs` since this is the default in CoreUI\n\n// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)\n@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }\n\n// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)\n@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }\n\n// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)\n@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }\n\n// X-Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)\n@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }\n\n// XX-Large devices (larger desktops, 1400px and up)\n@media (min-width: 1400px) { ... }\n```\n\n### Max-width\n\nWe occasionally use media queries that go in the other direction (the given screen size *or smaller*):\n\n```scss\n// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it's effectively `@media (max-width: 0) { ... }`\n@include media-breakpoint-down(sm) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-down(md) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-down(lg) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-down(xl) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-down(xxl) { ... }\n\n// Example: Style from medium breakpoint and down\n@include media-breakpoint-down(md) {\n.custom-class {\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese mixins take those declared breakpoints, subtract `.02px` from them, and use them as our `max-width` values. For example:\n\n```scss\n// X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)\n@media (max-width: 575.98px) { ... }\n\n// Small devices (landscape phones, less than 768px)\n@media (max-width: 767.98px) { ... }\n\n// Medium devices (tablets, less than 992px)\n@media (max-width: 991.98px) { ... }\n\n// Large devices (desktops, less than 1200px)\n@media (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }\n\n// X-Large devices (large desktops, less than 1400px)\n@media (max-width: 1399.98px) { ... }\n\n// XX-Large devices (larger desktops)\n// No media query since the xxl breakpoint has no upper bound on its width\n```\n\n"),e.fQ9(),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(67,"div",3)(68,"strong"),e._uU(69,"Why subtract .02px?"),e.qZA(),e._uU(70," Browsers don\u2019t currently support "),e.TgZ(71,"a",4),e._uU(72,"range context queries"),e.qZA(),e._uU(73,", so we work around the limitations of "),e.TgZ(74,"a",5)(75,"code"),e._uU(76,"min-"),e.qZA(),e._uU(77," and "),e.TgZ(78,"code"),e._uU(79,"max-"),e.qZA(),e._uU(80," prefixes"),e.qZA(),e._uU(81," and viewports with fractional widths (which can occur under certain conditions on high-dpi devices, for instance) by using values with higher precision.\n"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(82,"markdown"),e.IAx(),e._uU(83,"\n### Single breakpoint\n\nThere are also media queries and mixins for targeting a single segment of screen sizes using the minimum and maximum breakpoint widths.\n\n```scss\n@include media-breakpoint-only(xs) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(sm) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(lg) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(xl) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(xxl) { ... }\n```\n\nFor example the `@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }` will result in :\n\n```scss\n@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991.98px) { ... }\n```\n\n### Between breakpoints\n\nSimilarly, media queries may span multiple breakpoint widths:\n\n```scss\n@include media-breakpoint-between(md, xl) { ... }\n```\n\nWhich results in:\n\n```scss\n// Example\n// Apply styles starting from medium devices and up to extra large devices\n@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }\n```\n"),e.fQ9(),e.qZA()),2&i&&(e.xp6(3),e.Oqu(m.description))},dependencies:[s.lF,c.E],styles:["[_nghost-%COMP%]{display:block}"],changeDetection:0}),n})()}];let g=(()=>{class n{}return n.\u0275fac=function(i){return new(i||n)},n.\u0275mod=e.oAB({type:n}),n.\u0275inj=e.cJS({imports:[r.Bz.forChild(h),r.Bz]}),n})();var x=t(417);let f=(()=>{class n{}return n.\u0275fac=function(i){return new(i||n)},n.\u0275mod=e.oAB({type:n}),n.\u0275inj=e.cJS({imports:[g,s.JP.forChild(),p.U,a.m,x.K]}),n})()}}]);
