      <description>&lt;p&gt;Commonly known as the most popular JavaScript framework… Wait… React JS is indeed based on JavaScript, but we’re not so sure about naming it a framework because… it’s rather a library? Which comes first, the chicken or the egg? ;) No matter if we prefer chicken or egg, there’s no argue that React.js is number 1. Netflix, Instagram, and Facebook are just at the beginning of the long list of web apps developed thanks to React.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Searching for the right tools for the job has always fascinated developers. Many front-end developers agree that using a widely accepted framework keeps your code lightweight yet robust. That is why many programmers are switching to the React UI Framework - a leading framework that enables effortless runtime performance in cutting-edge UIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ticks all the boxes when building high fidelity, reusable components that can handle high loading and rendering scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With React, you can design, build and understand a user interface that scales across screens and the browser by separating its data layer from presentation logic. React UI framework and component libraries are at the core of JavaScript to enable unique and highly customisable user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s post is about the 8 Best React UI Framework and Component Libraries in 2022. So, let&amp;rsquo;s start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>React v18.0 – finally is of legal age?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s almost a month after official presentation on npm, so it’s we’re ready to roll with our remarks on the latest React version. As you know, CoreUI &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreui.io/&#34;&gt;Admin Panel&lt;/a&gt; is not another blend of 3rd parties’ free components and libraries. It&amp;rsquo;s the only Open-Source &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreui.io/react&#34;&gt;React Admin Dashboard Template&lt;/a&gt; built on the enterprise-grade hand-crafted &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreui.io/react/&#34;&gt;React UI Components Library&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why we’ve waited patiently for React v18.0, to materialize it e.g. here &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreui.io/react/&#34;&gt;https://coreui.io/react/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Saying that Vue.js is one of the fastest-growing JavaScript frameworks is almost like saying nothing. It has a profound collection of external libraries and frameworks that make developing applications quick and easy, even without any prior experience. When talking about Vue’s growth, it relates to the framework’s simplicity, availability of libraries, components, and learning materials like e.g. vueschool.io to strengthen the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do we need UI components?</title>
      <link>https://coreui.io/blog/2021/10/27/do-we-need-ui-components/</link>

      <guid>https://coreui.io/blog/2021/10/27/do-we-need-ui-components/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s not a secret (especially here), that the User Interface (UI) is a huge part of every app. Some say that if the icon is the front door, the UI is the interior design [that’s why CoreUI brings you both icons and components ;)]. Of course, you can take the route of completely designing your own UI from scratch, but… we all suffer from a lack of time. So if you want to get it up and running fast while still having a polished finish, an appropriate UI library seems to be the right option.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It cannot be an accident, cause just as we’ve released 90+ Bootstrap based
Vue.js components and directives our friends from VueSchool.io told us
about their Nuxt Nation Conference 2021. So, joint forces of CoreUI and
VueSchool are happy to announce, that a lot of good things will be brought
into Vue.js’ World this September.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear CoreUI, I am a researcher working at ISTAT, last week I participated in European Big Data Hackathon 2021, organized by Eurostat. And we won using CoreUI Vue.js!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Bootstrap v5 arrived – even though it’s alpha, we’re eager to get more</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We bet you all know the Buggles’ song:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-3&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe class=&#34;embed-responsive-item&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8r-tXRLazs&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every week last years we’ve heard that jQuery is slowly going into nowhere, when e.g. Vue.js is striving it’s way to popularity. So is the story with the Buggles’ song “Video killed the radio star”, where title seems to tell everything. Latest Bootstrap Blog: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/&#34;&gt;https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the final conformation for Jquery – bolded text tells everything: “Bootstrap no longer depends on jQuery”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? CoreUI did the same almost year ago. It’s good to know that we’re in a good company – what’s even more sexy is that we did it first 😊&lt;/p&gt;</description>

No way – from now on, you can use CoreUI icons for free. We’re open source, so it should be for free. Save your time and drag them in your design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve been asking us to introduce CoreUI for #Laravel and as you know – &lt;strong&gt;your wish is our command&lt;/strong&gt; 😉, so here it is: &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreui.io/laravel/&#34;&gt;https://coreui.io/laravel/&lt;/a&gt; You can check both Free and PRO versions. What’s inside? Saying a bunch of responsive, customizable, and reusable components you need to create modern, beautiful, responsive apps is saying (almost) nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-beta-version-has-just-been-released&#34;&gt;The beta version has just been released.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some say… 😉 that CoreUI admin template is one of the most popular open-source &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreui.io&#34;&gt;admin panel template&lt;/a&gt;. Some may ask – why? Because it delivers all responsive, customizable, and reusable components, you might need to create simply beautiful &amp;amp; responsive apps. But the beauty would be nothing without time-to-market. So please cordially welcome CoreUI 3.0 (beta).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s no discussion that, Bootstrap is one of the most popular responsive frameworks available, since Twitter released it in 2011. Thanks to an extensive library of cutting edge components, add-ons and plugins it enables fresh ideas and unconventional approach to every next web project. So there’s no wonder then, that not more than a week ago we’ve heard about Bootstrap 3.0.1, and just two days ago we’ve got Bootstrap 3.0.2. But as our dear old grannies used to say: never too much of a good thing…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Show me your cards (not, not Bootstrap themes yet)… As we’re all waiting for top mobile devices premieres, I bet we’re all satisfied right now. Apple showed its iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s – for the first time in history mobile device has been equipped with 64 bit CPU – future yet to come? On the other side, Samsung launched its Gear and Note III during IFA fair trade in Berlin&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We introduced our Genius &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreui.io&#34;&gt;Bootstrap Admin Template&lt;/a&gt;. But does the name oblige? If we look at some of the features like Bootstrap 3.0.0, write with LESS and almost 1500 icon (among them Glyphicons PRO), you can easily say that Genius Bootstrap can be(come) Einstein in the world of Bootstrap templates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
